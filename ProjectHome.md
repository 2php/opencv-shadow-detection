A multithreaded implementation of MVO's recognition with shadow detection and background suppression.
This software uses an algorithm for detecting moving objects from a static background
scene that contains shading and shadows using color images. We develop a robust and
efficiently computed background subtraction algorithm that is able to cope with local
illumination changes, such as shadows and highlights, as well as global illumination
changes. We have applied this method to real image sequences of both simple and
complex scenes, obtaining good results in both cases. The results, which demonstrate the
system's performance, and some speed up techniques we employed in our
implementation are shown in a ROC.
